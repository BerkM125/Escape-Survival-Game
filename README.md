# Escape-Survival-Game
This was one of my projects when I was tinkering with Roblox Studio for a while. I combined elements such as cannons, characters, vehicles, moving platforms, and obstacle courses to create this game.
# How it Works
This game is a survival/escape game that is actually pretty fun. You start off on a small island with pirates and explosive cannons. You have to escape this island and get on a  very unsteady raft below that will (with AI pathfinding) take you the shores of an island. From there, you aim to reach an island in the distance, but be careful not to get hit by the flaming cannon balls shot by the pirates. If and once you make it there, you will find out that the island is inhabited by armed soldiers (AI) who, although they can't shoot, can kill you on impact. You must navigate your way away from the soldiers, through rigged dynamite, and around firing cannons and find a way off the island. BE WARNED: there is an active volcano, and stepping on certain areas may trigger an eruption.

All of this is powered by Roblox Studio (make sure to check it out it's actually very interesting for Lua enthusiasts) and I got a bunch of these ideas from my friends.
